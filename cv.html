overview:
  - I'm a computer scientist with 9+ years of professional software development
    experience. After completing both a bachelor's and master's degree in
    computer science I began my career, which has mainly consisted of
    back-end and full-stack positions. Throughout this time I've mainly worked
    with Java, Python, and the ecosystems supporting their use.
    More recently I've also had the opportunity to gain considerable experience with
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) while developing systems that utilize the platform.

      - "Over my three years at Western Digital I was involved in several main
        activities: PHP-based server-side development to support the EdgeRover
        application, Java cloud services development, and an overhaul of the CI/CD
        process."
      - During my first year at Western Digital I worked as part of a small
        cross-functional team on the modification of an acquired PHP-based backend
        service for content cataloguing and management. Our solution supported the
        EdgeRover application by indexing and providing centralized access (via
        OAuth flows) to user's files and their metadata as retrieved from multiple
        3rd party sources (eg. Facebook, Flickr, Google Drive). Some highlights of
        my contributions during this time include improvements to thumbnail
        generation and increasing feature parity across integrations (Dropbox,
        Flickr).
      - After supporting the EdgeRover application our team joined the DevOps
        group in an effort to improve the CI/CD process. Given a directive to
        decrease build & deployment times we began by assessing our current tools
        in comparison to possible alternatives, eventually opting to transition to
        GitHub, GitHub Actions (GHA), Pulumi for IaC, and JFrog Artifactory. My
        contributions on this project included architecture documentation and
        recommendations for the code build automation tool, versioning approach,
        and artifact storage, as well as templated workflows for GHA. By the end
        of the project (cut short as it was put on hold) we had a successful proof
        of concept available that when extended to all microservices would reduce
        build & deployment times by an expected order of magnitude.
      - The remainder of my time at Western Digital consisted of supporting the
        cloud services. Specifically this meant bug fixes, security patches, minor
        feature requests, and other maintenance items related to a few dozen Java
        (Spring Boot) and NodeJS-based mircoservices that support the suite of WD
        devices.

      - Recommended for the position by a colleague, I began work at Nuvyyo
        with the primary responsibility of bringing in-house the previously
        outsourced Cloud DVR project. The project itself consisted of a Java
        application deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 which allowed
        customer devices to record & watch television programs using cloud
        storage as opposed to an external hard drive.

      - Following contract and term positions at Espial, I was hired on as a
        contractor at Nomad.Works to assist with Python/Django development.
        Working as a full-stack developer, most of my time was spent
        implementing billing and reporting features for an advanced
        accommodation system.
      - Specifically, this included all steps of the development process from
        receiving client requirements to deployment; refining requirements for
        better clarity, definition of Django models, implementation of the web
        pages containing forms and optionally-generated data, implementation of
        complex queries with post-processing, data transformation, customized
        display via stacked bar chart using D3.js, generation of summary
        statistics for revenue and occupancy rates over varying time frames,
        and tests to ensure correct aggregation of guest data for the
        implemented features.

      - After working at Espial through a contract with Dever Domain Inc., I
        was offered an additional six-month position as a Media Services
        Platform (MSP) Cloud Developer directly through Espial. Joined by
        another full-time colleague and a few co-op students, our scrum team
        focused on internal tools and modernization (modularization and
        containerization) of an older core product.
      - Our work mainly dealt with improvements to our groupâ€™s software
        engineering processes around software builds, version control, load
        testing, internal metrics, and code standards.

        system-level components for an Over-The-Top (OTT) Video On Demand (VOD)
        solution for the German cable provider Tele Columbus.
      - Placed as a lead developer of the Workflow Manager application, I
        implemented several large pieces of the system along with carrying out
        unit testing, and assisting in system testing. Responsibilities in this
        role also included documentation of the application for eventual handoff
        for maintenance, and providing training to those maintainers. Development
        was made more interesting both as I had the opportunity to work directly
        with the media content providers to determine a standard for content
        metadata, as well as working within a distributed project team with
        colleagues located in Ottawa, Cambridge, Berlin, and Leipzig.
      - Lastly, while wrapping up the project I assisted in installation and
        configuration of the system both remotely, and at the client site in
        Leipzig.

      - In the fall semester, I assisted teaching the Introduction to Computer
        Science I course. The covered material began with an introduction to the
        Python programming language, with the Pygame library being used in
        several assignments. A basic introduction to algorithms (minimum,
        maximum, and median finding) was also included in the course, as well
        as a brief overview of Java.
      - For the winter semester I was a teaching assistant for the Fundamentals
        of Web Applications course, which focused mainly on development of web
        applications using JavaScript with Node.js and Mongodb. The material was
        introduced gradually, first focusing only on server-side JavaScript,
        which was followed by integration of CSS styling, templating (Jade),
        database usage, and client-side JavaScript. Assignments themselves dealt
        with implementation and use of web forms, secure & persistent sessions,
        web sockets, simple games, and a basic web server.
      - For both terms, my duties included learning any new material before the
        students, marking assignments, holding office hours, and teaching
        tutorials to reinforce the material taught during lectures.

        flight planning system (CFPS) to replace another decade-old system.
      - This time around I worked more-so on fixing defects as the deadline for
        the first release was nearing. Along with polishing the system, I was
        still able to implement a few features; a basic CMS for site
        administrators, and some PostGIS mapping for the start of the weather
        system integration/development.

        system (CFPS) at the beginning of its implementation stage. It was
        designed to allow users to file flight plans from the web, replacing the
        current method of either filling out a paper form or calling in to a
        flight service station. Integration with weather and other systems is
        also planned.
      - The scrum (agile) development process was used with week-long sprints,
        with development being done on linux fedora machines. A chroot
        environment along with virtualenv was used to target the cluster
        production environment, with python-django as the main
        language/framework and twitter bootstrap to help with the ui.

        Hadoop framework for scheduling workflows onto resources rented from
        cloud service providers. Investigated in our work is budget-constrained
        workflow scheduling on the Hadoop MapReduce platform, wherein we devise
        both an optimal and a heuristic approach to minimize workflow makespan
        while satisfying a given budget constraint. We have implemented
        modifications to the Apache Hadoop framework to execute these approaches,
        allowing fully integrated workflow scheduling.
