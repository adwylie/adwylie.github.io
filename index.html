            <p>Hi. I'm <strong>Andrew Wylie</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              I make things from time to time. The 'what' varies, though
              usually relates to electronics or software. I tend to lean
              towards the DIY path for projects, with generally good results. I
              believe that having strong research skills helps, along with a
              motivation to both learn new things and apply the knowledge. I
              try to keep my life balanced by staying active, which usually
              amounts to cycling, climbing, or running/hiking.  Though staying
              in and playing the guitar is also a blast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Academically, I've completed both an undergraduate and master's
              degree in computer science. Participating in the cooperative
              education program and tutoring along the way was also neat. I
              just loved seeing the shift in thought when a student finally
              understood the material. During my career I've worked with a
              varying set of technologies, mostly within the air traffic
              control, telecommunications, and defense industries. As a result
              I'd probably label myself a generalist, though if given the
              chance though I still have a soft spot in my heart for python
              and javascript :).
